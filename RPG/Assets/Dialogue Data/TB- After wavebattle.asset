  - "Pepper-\nHey, why didn\u2019t you attack us back there?"
  - 'Toy Soldier-

    Why, did you want me to?'
  - 'Pepper-

    Well, no, but all those others attacked us but not you'
  - "Toy Soldier-\nThat\u2019s because they\u2019re all under Jackyll\u2019s insane
    control"
  - 'Toy Soldier-

    Over the past few days he has been practically kidnapping
    or tricking others and then somehow brainwashing them.'
  - "Pepper-\nAnd you\u2019re somehow not?"
  - 'Toy Soldier-

    Well, he has a few dozen in his army right now, which is practically
    everyone who lives here so I just pretended to be brainwashed'
  - 'Pepper-

    Jeez, well sorry if we beat up someone you knew back there'
  - "Toy Soldier-\nOnly my cousin, but that\u2019s ok."
  - "Toy Soldier-\nHonestly i\u2019m kinda happy you guys did that cause he owes
    me like 40 bucks, so we're cool."
  - 'Pepper-

    Alright, stay safe out there I guess.'
  - 'Toy Soldier-

    No promises.'
