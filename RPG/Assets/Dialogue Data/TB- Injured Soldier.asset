  - 'Pepper-

    Hey Mr Soldier, I was wondering if you have seen anything new drop
    by recently?'
  - "Pepper-\nThere\u2019s this object that me and my friend here are searching for,
    can you point us in the right direction?"
  - 'Injured Soldier-

    The horrors I just witnessed. Friends and family turning
    against each other.'
  - "Pepper-\nOk, that was totally not on topic at all\u2026 What\u2019s going on
    with you?"
  - 'Injured Soldier-

    Just a few days ago everything was perfectly peaceful,
    all us toys got along just fine.'
  - 'Injured Soldier-

    Then, that...thing...came along and started to create
    an army of toys and take over the land.'
  - 'Pepper-

    Oh my, is that how you got injured?'
  - "Injured Soldier-\nNah, some dog chewed my leg off a few weeks ago, but I'm more
    traumatised by what\u2019s going on right now than that."
  - "Injured Soldier-\nLook, if you\u2019re going in there, be careful. I recommend
    you don\u2019t but I feel like you\u2019re gonna go in there no matter what I
    say."
  - 'Pepper-

    Yeah, you right.'
